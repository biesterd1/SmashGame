Early stages of smash bros-type 2D multiplayer arena brawler.
Still working on the basic mechanics of hitboxes and movement.

Spawning is now fully working.

	To do (spawning)-

  	Add spawn platforms so players do not fall right away

  	Invicible for time after spawning

  	Code multiple spawn points so players do not spawn on top of each other if they die at similar times

Down smash is working, but only in one direction. Trying to combine the direction of the attacker, with the distance between the two players, and the position of the target to "bounce" target back and forth until the final attack stroke.
