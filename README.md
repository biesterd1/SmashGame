Early stages of smash bros-type 2D multiplayer arena brawler.
Still working on the basic mechanics of hitboxes and movement.

Down smash is working, but only in one direction. Trying to combine the direction of the attacker, with the distance between the two players, and the position of the target to "bounce" target back and forth until the final attack stroke.
